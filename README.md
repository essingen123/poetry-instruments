# Make and Play Your Own Poetry Instrument
In this class we will build poetry instruments and try to get good at playing them. By 'instrument ' I mean an interactive work that can be played differently each time, has a learning curve and can be remixed and improvised when performed live. We will build our instruments using Javascript keyboard events to control the text on the screen, and also corresponding sounds, images and animations (depending on how deep you want to go).

###Day 1
* Play around with some web instruments / poetry instruments
  * [Patatap](http://patatap.com)
  * [Sweet Old Etcetera](http://collection.eliterature.org/2/works/clifford_sweet_old_etcetera/sweetweb/sweetoldetc.html)
  * [GifRapBot](http://hotwriting.net/gifRapBot)
* Talk about Javascript functions and jQuery Interactivity
* Try modifying existing instrument code for new results
* Discuss writing for this medium

**HW:** Design and write a poetry instrument. What will the interactions be? What do you want it to feel like to play? Write the text, gather the images and sounds you want to use, we'll put it all together in the next class.
###Day2
* Introduce core js interactivity functions
  * Sound - Blocking and non-blocking
  * Images
  * jQuery Animation
  * Add text letter-by-leter
  * Button mash
* Work on our instruments
* Perform our instruments and play each other's

###Things we'll be using
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) - core library for interactive websites
* [Mousetrap](http://craig.is/killing/mice) - small library for easily binding keyboard events
* [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) - local web server that runs real fast
* [Freesound.org](http://freesound.org) - great source for sound effects
* [Google Images](http://images.google.com) - where else are you gonna find your animated gifs?
